|| height || false || The height of the Streetviewpanaroma. || 500 ||
|| zoom || false || The zoom value of the Streetviewpanaroma. zoom defines the zoom level of this view (effectively proscribing the "field of view") with 0 being fully zoomed-out. Different Street View locations may provide higher or lower zoom levels. || 0 ||

(For example, an image taken on a hill will likely exhibit a default pitch that is not horizontal.) Pitch angles are measured with negative values looking up (to -90 degrees straight up and orthogonal to the default pitch) and positive values looking down (to +90 degrees straight down and orthogonal to the default pitch). || 0 ||
